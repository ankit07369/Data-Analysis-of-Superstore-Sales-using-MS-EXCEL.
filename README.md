Project Title: Sales Analysis of Superstore

Introduction:
This project aims to analyze the sales data of a Superstore to uncover valuable insights that can inform decision-making and improve business performance. The primary objectives include analyzing sales trends by product category, understanding customer segments, examining monthly sales patterns, evaluating order priorities, and more.

ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):

Data Extraction: Data is extracted from various sources, including a Kaggle dataset.
Data Transformation: The dataset undergoes several transformations, including removing blank cells, unnecessary columns, and duplicates, standardizing column names, handling NULL values, and formatting data appropriately.
Data Loading: The cleaned and transformed data is loaded into a suitable data analysis tool (e.g., Tableau) for further analysis.

Scope of Analysis:

1.Monthly Sales and Profit Analysis
2.Segment Distribution by Product Category
3.Monthly Sales Trends
4.Sales Analysis by Order Priority
5.Product Category Comparison
6.Employee Performance Analysis

Analysis Results:
